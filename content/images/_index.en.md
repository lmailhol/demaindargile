## Behind the scene

> [Thai-Binh Phan-Van](https://thaibinhphanvan.com/Photographies/Argile), a Dijon based photographer accompanied us during the reality-part of the shooting.  
For the fable, the colour photographs are by Marion Boisard, those in b&w by Manu Mathias.
Here is a small selection of these beautiful pictures and a big thank you to them.
