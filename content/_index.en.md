### Synopsis

> **Jeanne, a poet, loses one of her stories while visiting a museum.**  
The story depicts, in the style of a fable, the complexity of her life, her relationship with man and often the violence that comes with it.  
**This strange letter ends up, by a coincidence, in the hands of Anton, an art student quite disturbed by this discovery.**

The movie follows two axes in which the sequences are intertwined:  
**a real dimension and an imaginary one containing passages from the fable written by Jeanne.**
